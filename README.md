# flask-vuejs-survey

The application code for a tutorial blog series that demonstrates how to build a full-stack survey application using Python's Flask micro web framework and the Vue.js JavaScript framework.  The Vue.js framework is used for constructing an interactive and complete single page application (SPA), while the Flask framework is used to develop a RESTful API to consume, persist, and produce data for the front-end SPA.

The tutorial consists of a series of linked blog articles on [Stackabuse](http://stackabuse.com/) linked to branches on this GitHub account with the contents shown below.
